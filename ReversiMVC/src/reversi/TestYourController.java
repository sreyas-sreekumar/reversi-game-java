/*
 * This is a very simple test model and view to test your controller once you think it has finished.
 * If your controller fails one of the tests on here, then it will also fail at least one of the tests when I mark it.
 * This is a very cut-down version of my test class, which will do a lot more automatic checks.
 * This file is designed to avoid giving you implementations that you can copy-paste for your coursework, so a lot of my checks had to be missed out.
 * e.g. this file will check that all of the messages that you send are are valid and sent at the right times, but not that you send messages at all.
 *  
 * When you are ready to test your controller, find the line below labelled TODO in main(), then change which of the following lines is commented out.
 * (I had to do this otherwise the code will not compile until you create your ReversiController.)
 * Then run this class.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: to ensure that the test code doesn't give you answers to the coursework, this class implements both the model and the GUI, and also reimplements some of the controller functionality to allow me to test it. 
 * You will not be able to just copy-paste some of the code and have it work, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work if you add it to the controller or GUI.
